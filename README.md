# playcar-screenshots

A script that uses browser automation (selenium) to navigate the mobile.playcar.com website and take a screenshot of every page

UPDATE: as of feb. 10 2023 this script no longer works correctly as the playcar website has seen major changes and has been completely overhauled as a result of the company's rebranding.
